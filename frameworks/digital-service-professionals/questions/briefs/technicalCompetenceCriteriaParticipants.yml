question: Technical competence criteria
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do.

  Evaluate suppliers’ technical competence using criteria for:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposal

  ##Giving points for individual criteria (optional)
  You can give points to individual criteria, eg ‘have experience recruiting participants with low digital literacy – 15 points’. 

  The points you give for nice-to-have skills and experience must be lower than the points you give for 
  essential skills and experience and proposal criteria.
