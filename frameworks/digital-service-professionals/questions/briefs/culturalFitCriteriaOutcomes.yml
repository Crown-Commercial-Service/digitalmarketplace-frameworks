question: Cultural fit criteria
question_advice: |
  Cultural fit is how well you and the individual or team will work together. If the supplier’s values and behaviour
  are similar to your organisation’s, they should be a good cultural fit.

  You must tell suppliers if you want to score individual criteria.
