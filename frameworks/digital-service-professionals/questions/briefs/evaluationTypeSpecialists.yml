       References are a good way of confirming whether a specialist has done the work they’ve said they’ve 
       done. You should always ask for references that relate to a specific time frame, for example the work they’ve done in the 
       last 2 years.

       An interview can help you understand whether a specialist or team has the skills needed to work on your project.
        It will also help you see whether they will be a good fit for your existing team. You should follow an agreed 
        format and ask all specialists the same questions.
