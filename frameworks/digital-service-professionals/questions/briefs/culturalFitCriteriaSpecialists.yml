  Cultural fit is how well you and the individual or team will work together. If the supplier’s values and behaviour
  are similar to your organisation’s, they should be a good cultural fit.

  You must tell suppliers if you want to score individual criteria.

  Suggested criteria

  - Work as a team with our organisation and other suppliers
  - Transparent and collaborative when making decisions
  - Have a no-blame culture and encourage people to learn from their mistakes
