    The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) proposes to make some minor changes to the framework agreement and call-off

    These minor changes were agreed in the answers provided to suppliers while G-Cloud 8 applications were open. 
    The changes make it easier for suppliers to work with government and are listed here.
