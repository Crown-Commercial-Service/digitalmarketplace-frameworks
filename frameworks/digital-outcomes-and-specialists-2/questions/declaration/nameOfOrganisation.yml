question: What is the full name of the organisation applying to the Digital Outcomes and Specialists 2 framework agreement?

hint: For a group of economic operators, this will be the name of the lead organisation (or the separate entity such as a special purpose vehicle if you have already created one). If you’re submitting a response on behalf of another organisation, use their company name and details, not yours.
