question: How you’ll assess suppliers
question_advice: |
  You must ask all suppliers that reach the assessment stage for a written proposal.

  Choose additional ways to assess suppliers.

  You can only use the methods you choose here, eg if you don’t select a case study now, you won’t be able to ask for one later.

options:
  - label: "Case study"
    description: >
       A case study is a good way to see the work suppliers have done before. It can help you understand whether the
       people who’ll be working on your project have the right skills and experience.
  - label: "Work history"
    description: >
       A work history lists the previous work a supplier has done. It should give you a view of the skills and
       experience of the team members who’ll be working on your project.
  - label: "Reference"
    description: >
       A written reference is a good way of confirming whether a supplier has done the work they’ve said they’ve done.
       You should always ask for references that relate to a specific timeframe, eg work they’ve done in the last
       2 years.
  - label: "Presentation"
    description: >
       A presentation can help you understand a supplier’s approach to delivering an outcome, eg a practical
       demonstration of a prototype or discovery kick-off meeting.
