    label: Fixed price
    description: >
      A fixed price approach can be more expensive because the supplier owns most of the risk. It works best when your
      requirements are well defined so the supplier can provide an accurate quote without incorporating extra costs.
      The supplier must do all the work you specify in each particular ‘statement of work’ within the time you agreed
      it would take.
  -
    label: Time and materials
    description: >
      A time and materials approach means you own more of the risk. The supplier can send a pricing matrix showing
      how long they need to provide the work. If it takes longer to do the work defined in a statement of work, you
      pay the day rate and expenses for any extra days worked.
  -
    label: Capped time and materials
    description: >
      A capped time and materials approach is the same as a time and materials approach but there’s a limit on how
      much you have to pay for the work. If you reach the limit before the work is finished, the supplier has to
      complete the work at their own cost. If the supplier finishes the work before they said they would, you only
      pay them for the time they took to do the work.
