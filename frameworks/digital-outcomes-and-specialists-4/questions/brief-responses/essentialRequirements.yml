question: Give evidence of the essential skills and experience
question_advice: |
  The buyer will assess and score your evidence to shortlist the best suppliers.

  Youâ€™ll need to meet or exceed their requirements to get through to the next stage.

  ## Evidence structure
  
  When you write your evidence, you should be specific about:

  * what the situation was
  * the work {% if brief.lotSlug == 'digital-outcomes' %}the team{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'digital-specialists' %}the specialist{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'user-research-participants' %}you{% endif %} did
  * what the results were

  You should only provide one example for each essential requirement (unless the buyer specifies otherwise).

  You can reuse examples across different essential or nice-to-have requirements if you need to.
