question_advice: |
  As the buyer, you are the client when buying a supply of resource. As a result, you are responsible for determining if the off-payroll working rules (IR35) apply.

  Is the requirement for a contracted out service (where you outsource all ownership and responsibility for delivery to a supplier) or
  a supply of resource (where you engage an individual or team of individuals to work with your staff, and exercise operational direction and control)?
