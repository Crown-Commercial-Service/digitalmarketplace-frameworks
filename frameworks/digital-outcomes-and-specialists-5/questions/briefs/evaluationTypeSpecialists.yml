  - label: "Reference"
    description: >
      A written reference is a good way of confirming whether a specialist has done the work they’ve said they’ve
      done. You should always ask for references that relate to a specific timeframe, such as work they’ve done
      in the last 2 years.
  - label: "Interview"
    description: >
      An interview can help you understand whether a specialist or team has the skills needed to work on your project.
      It will also help you see whether they will be a good fit for your existing team. You should follow an agreed
      format in which you ask all specialists the same set of questions.
  - label: "Scenario or test"
    description: >
      A scenario or test can help you confirm a supplier’s skill level and understanding in a controlled environment,
      for example: a coding test for a developer or the approach a product manager would take to solve an example problem.
  - label: "Presentation"
    description: >
      A presentation can help you understand a specialist’s approach to delivering work,
      for example: a practical demonstration of a prototype or discovery kick-off meeting.
