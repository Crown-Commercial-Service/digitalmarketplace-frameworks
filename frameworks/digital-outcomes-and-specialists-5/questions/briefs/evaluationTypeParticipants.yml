       people who’ll be working on your project have the right skills and experience.
  - label: "Reference"
    description: >
       A written reference is a good way of confirming whether a supplier has done the work they’ve said they’ve done.
       You should always ask for references that relate to a specific timeframe, such as work they’ve done in the last
       2 years.
  - label: "Interview"
    description: >
       An interview can help you understand whether a supplier or team has the skills needed to work on your project.
       It will also help you see whether they will be a good fit for your existing team. You should follow an agreed
       format in which you ask all suppliers the same set of questions.
