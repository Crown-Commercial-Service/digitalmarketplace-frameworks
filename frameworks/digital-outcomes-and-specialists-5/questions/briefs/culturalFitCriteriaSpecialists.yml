question: Cultural fit criteria
question_advice: |

  Cultural fit is about how well you and the specialist work together.

  ##Cultural fit is:
  - how the specialist works with other people
  - how the specialist solves problems
  - the specialist’s approach to making decisions
  - how the specialist shares knowledge and experience
  - the specialist’s attitude to making mistakes

  ##Cultural fit isn’t:
  - whether the specialist looks, talks or behaves in the same way as you
  - about having agile skills – that’s technical competence

  ##Giving points for individual criteria (optional)
  You can give points to individual criteria, such as ‘transparent and collaborative when making decisions – 15 points’. If you choose to add points, you must do it for all individual criteria.
