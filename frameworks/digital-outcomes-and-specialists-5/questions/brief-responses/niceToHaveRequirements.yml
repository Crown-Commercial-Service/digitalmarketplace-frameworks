  All nice-to-have skills and experience are optional.

  The buyer will assess and score your evidence to shortlist the best suppliers.

  ## Evidence structure
  
  When you write your evidence, you should be specific about:

  * what the situation was
  * the work {% if brief.lotSlug == 'digital-outcomes' %}the team{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'digital-specialists' %}the specialist{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'user-research-participants' %}you{% endif %} did
  * what the results were

  You should only provide one example for each nice-to-have requirement (unless the buyer specifies otherwise).

  You can reuse examples across different essential or nice-to-have requirements if you need to.
