question: Where will your agile coach work?
question_advice: Choose all the locations where the specialist can work at buyers’ sites, and whether they can work offsite.
hint: >
    ‘Offsite’ means the specialist will not be working at the buyer’s own sites. You can change where the specialist is available to work at any time during the framework.
