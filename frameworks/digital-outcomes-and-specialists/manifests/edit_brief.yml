    After you’ve published your requirements, specialists will apply and tell you:

    - when they can start work
    - if they have the essential skills and experience
    - which nice-to-have skills and experience they have

    You can shortlist the specialists who:

    - can start work when you need them to
    - meet all the essential skills and experience
    - provide the most nice-to-have skills and experience

  step: 2

    You need to tell suppliers how you’re going to evaluate them when you publish your requirements.

    To find the most suitable supplier, you must evaluate your shortlist on:

    - technical competence, eg how well the supplier's skills or proposed solution meet your needs
    - ‘cultural fit’, eg how the supplier will work in your organisation
    - the price of the proposed solution

  name: Describe question and answer session

  step: 3

    While the application period is open, you need to reply to all questions suppliers ask about your requirements.

    When a supplier asks a question, you’ll be sent an email to the email address you registered with.

    You’ll need to post all questions and answers on the Digital Marketplace so that all suppliers can see them.

    Providing a question and answer session means you can explain your needs and answer any questions quickly.
