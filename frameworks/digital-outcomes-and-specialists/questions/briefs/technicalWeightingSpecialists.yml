question: 'Technical competence'
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the specialist can do the work you need them to do. It’s also known as 
  ‘technical merit and functional fit’. If a specialist has the right skills and experience, a good understanding 
  of your requirements, and works in an agile way, they should have the technical competence to do the work.

  You must assess a supplier’s technical competence by reviewing their essential and nice-to-have skills and experience.
