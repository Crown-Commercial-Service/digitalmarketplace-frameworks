  All nice-to-have skills and experience are optional.

  The buyer will assess and score your evidence to shortlist the best suppliers.

  <h3>Evidence structure</h3>
  <div class="explanation-list">
    <p class="lead">When you write your evidence, you should be specific about:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>what the situation was</li>
      <li>the work {% if brief.lotSlug == 'digital-outcomes' %}the team{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'digital-specialists' %}the specialist{% elif brief.lotSlug == 'user-research-participants' %}you{% endif %} did</li>
      <li>what the results were</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  You should only provide one example for each nice-to-have requirement (unless the buyer specifies otherwise).

  You can reuse examples across different essential or nice-to-have requirements if you need to.
